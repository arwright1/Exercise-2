2D Catch game
This project is a simple 2D catch game. From the top of the screen, two objects will randomly be dropped (fishes and bombs). The player (basket controlled by user) should try and catch fishes. Each fish caught will result in a 10-point increment. When a bomb is caught, the game will be over.
